I'm a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science, <a href='https://english.tau.ac.il/'>Tel Aviv University</a>, in the <a href='https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~maozs/group.htmlc'>Software Modeling Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href='https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~maozs/index.html'>Prof. Shahar Maoz</a>. 

My research interests are in the intersection of Software Engineering, Programming Languages, and HCI. Currently, I am working on making reactive synthesis more usable as part of the <a href='https://smlab.cs.tau.ac.il/syntech/'>SYNTECH</a> project.

Before joining TAU, I completed my MSc. at Technion under the supervision of Prof. Yosi Gil and was a visiting researcher at the Penrose research group at Carnegie Mellon University, hosted by Prof. Joshua Sunshine.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
